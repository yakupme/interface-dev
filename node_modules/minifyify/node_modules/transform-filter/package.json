  "readme": "transform-filter\n================\n\n  Filter [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) transforms using glob patterns.\n\ninstall\n-------\n\n```\nnpm install transform-filter\n```\n\nusage\n-----\n\n  suspend your disbelief for a second and pretend that [coffeeify](https://github.com/substack/coffeeify) didn't filter the files itself:\n\n```javascript\nvar filterCoffee = filterTransform( coffeeify, {\n  include: ['**/*.coffee'],  // only run transform on matching files\n  exclude: ['**/subdir/**'], // because you don't want coffee files in `subdir` processed for some reason.\n  base: '/'                  // glob patterns matched relative to this `base` (defaults to process.cwd())\n});\n```\n\n  * `include` defaults to matching everything (i.e. everything is included).\n  * `exclude` defaults to matching nothing (i.e. nothing is excluded).\n  * You can use a `!` as the first character of any pattern to negate it\n\n     `exclude:['tests/**','!tests/utils.js']` excludes everything in the tests directory except `utils.js`\n\n  * Patterns can be a string, array of strings, null or undefined.\n  * `base` option is computed relative to `process.cwd()`. `base:'..'` would match from the parent directory.\n  Use a leading `/` for absolute urls.\n  * Exclude takes precedent over include.\n\n\nIf you need more control than glob patterns offer, check out [filter-transform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/filter-transform).\n\nIt offers similar filtering via a user supplied callback, and sparked the idea behind this module.\n\n\nlicence\n-------\n\n  MIT. &copy; James Talmage",
